# Welcome!
**Welcome on fuchscrafter.github.io!**
## Who am I?
I am FuchsCrafter (or FuchsCoder) And I like it to code cool things, mainly in the Web. Formerly, I used to only use HTML and PHP, but now, I use Interpretet languages like Lua and Python, but also compiled Languages like Kotlin. I also have knowlege about JavaScript and React, but Ihaven't done a project with them yet.

## What do I do? (My Work)
I have coded a few projects yet. The most known Project is Scratch2Py, which is not entirely by me, but I have contributed to it. I also made my Homepage on my own. A not so known Project of mine is skypy-api.
